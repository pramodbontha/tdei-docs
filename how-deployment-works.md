1. **Adding new content**
After adding the new file or new folder(category) in content folder and changes are looking fine, commit the files.

2. **Github workflow**
This will trigger a workflow that will build new application content in the background.

3. **Deployment**
The workflow will build the project and upload the generated artifacts to gihub-pages and site with new changes will be deployed.
